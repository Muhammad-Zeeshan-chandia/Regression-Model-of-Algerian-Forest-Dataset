# Algerian Forest Fires: EDA, Feature Selection & Model Training

This project involves exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature selection, and machine learning model training on the **Algerian Forest Fires Dataset**. The objective is to analyze environmental factors contributing to forest fires and build a predictive model to classify fire occurrence.

## 🔍 Notebooks Overview

### 1. `eda_feature_selection_algerian_forest.ipynb`
- Performs EDA on the dataset.
- Cleans and preprocesses the data.
- Visualizes trends and relationships between features.
- Implements feature selection techniques to identify important predictors.

### 2. `model_training.ipynb`
- Trains classification models to predict forest fires.
- Compares multiple algorithms for optimal results.

## 📁 Dataset
The dataset used contains meteorological and forest-related features from two regions in Algeria.
